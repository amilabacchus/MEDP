					<h3>The origin of the name “Heliotrope” is warmer than the purple it describes.</h3>
					<p><i>Heltiotrope</i> is a <em>super</em> interesting color. The heliotrope flower was first recorded as eliotrope in Old French, which came from the Greek words for “sun” (hēlios) and “a turn, change” (tropos). The Greek word hēliotropion described the sundials of the ancient world. Like a sundial, the heliotrope flower was perceived to follow the sun. Some ancient accounts even describe the flower as the force that carried the sun across the sky. Heliotrope first appeared in English as the flower name, then as a color name in 1882.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Heliotropes were admired for more than their characteristic color.</h3>
					<p>The heliotrope flower turns so noticeably toward the sun throughout the day that many metaphors were built around it. This commitment to find the sun gave heliotrope (color and flower) a meaning of devotion and eternal love. The sap of the heliotrope flower was also used frequently in food coloring from the Middle Ages to Early Modern French cuisine.</p>
					
					<h3>Heliotrope color is a favorite descriptor in literature.</h3>
					<p>Popular use of the color heliotrope through generations of literature gave the color name even greater clout. In James Joyce’s comedic Finnegans Wake, the answer to the Maggies’ riddle is “heliotrope.” In the fourth Harry Potter book, Polyjuice Potion, when brewed correctly, is described as having a “pleasant heliotrope color.” Even in entertainment, the scriptwriters of Hancock’s Half Hour used heliotrope color as a common reference.</p>
