<h3>
	Artist Statement 
</h3>
<p>
	I create art and designs in pursuit of helping young girls of color explore the arts and everything this field has to offer. Many times we are pushed to attain careers in the Sciences and neglect creative opportunities, but the arts have just as much merit and value that can help young girls to lead more fulfilling lives!
