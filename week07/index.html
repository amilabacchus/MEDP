			<h2>WHAT ARE WAVES ?</h2>
			<p>Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one place to another without transferring matter. They occur in various forms all around us, from the ripples on a pond to the sound we hear and the light we see. Understanding waves helps us explore phenomena in physics, engineering, and natural sciences, providing insight into both everyday experiences and advanced technologies.</p>
			<h2>TYPES OF WAVES !</h2>
			<h3>Mechanical Waves</h3>
			<p>Mechanical waves require a medium, such as water, air, or a solid substance, to travel through. This means they can only propagate if they have a material to move within, making them common in everyday phenomena like sound or ocean waves. Mechanical waves come in two primary forms: transverse and longitudinal. In transverse waves, particles in the medium move perpendicular to the direction the wave travels, as seen with ocean waves where water particles move up and down as the wave travels horizontally. Longitudinal waves, on the other hand, have particles that move parallel to the direction of the wave, as in sound waves where air particles compress and expand in the same direction as the wave's travel.</p>
			<h3>ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES</h3>
			<p>Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they donâ€™t require a medium and can travel through a vacuum, making them essential in both natural and technological contexts. These waves include a broad spectrum of types, from radio waves, which allow for wireless communication, to microwaves used in cooking and satellite transmissions. The visible light that enables us to see, X-rays used in medical imaging, and other types of radiation are also electromagnetic waves. They all travel at the speed of light in a vacuum but vary in wavelength and frequency, which affects their energy and use.</p>
			<h3>MATTER WAVES</h3>
			<p>Matter waves, a concept rooted in quantum mechanics, reveal an intriguing duality: particles like electrons behave as both particles and waves under certain conditions. Known as wave-particle duality, this phenomenon shows that at the subatomic level, energy and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, forming a fundamental concept in the study of quantum physics. This behavior of matter waves helps scientists explore and understand the underlying principles of atomic and subatomic interactions, expanding our knowledge of the very building blocks of the universe.</p>

			<h2>FUN FACTS !</h2>
		    	<ul>
		          <li><p>Tsunamis are long-wavelength waves generated by underwater disturbances like earthquakes, with devastating impacts due to their high energy.</p></li>
		          <li><p>We can hear sound waves between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, but animals like dogs and bats can hear higher frequencies.</p></li>
		          <li><p>Light exhibits properties of both waves and particles, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality, which is key in quantum physics.</p></li>
		          <li><p> Ocean waves can travel great distances across the globe. Swells generated by storms in the Pacific Ocean can reach shores in Australia, thousands of miles away, carrying energy across the open ocean.</p></li>
		          <li><p>When an object, like a jet, travels faster than the speed of sound, it creates shock waves that produce a sonic boom. This is an intense, loud noise due to compressed air waves, and it's why breaking the sound barrier is such a powerful experience.</p></li>
		          <li><p>Rainbows are formed by the refraction, dispersion, and reflection of light waves inside water droplets in the air, with different wavelengths bending by different amounts to form the spectrum of colors we see.</p></li>
